            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>
                We developed a visual analytics tool to explore and analyze user reviews for restaurants on Yelp. 
                We employ a novel opinion mining approach to decode why users rated a particular restaurant or a group of restaurants the way they did. 
                Our approach works on the neighborhood principle to define relationships between keywords. 
                Our tool allows exploratory analysis on the user reviews, and helps understand what users like or dislike about a particular restaurant or all restaurants in general. 
                It allows a user to filter restaurants or reviews by a combination of tokens, such as “good ambiance”, “free wifi service”, “friendly hostess”, “not very expensive” etc. 
                By plotting the rating variance, we can know how the presence/absence of specific token affected the user rating. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Our technique works on the following assumptions:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>That the user's review and rating can be transformed into a cause-and-effect relationship = Feature (noun)</li>
                <li>That the related keywords appear closer to each other in a review = Qualifier (adjective)</li>
                <li>That the presence or absence of certain keywords negate the opinion = Modifier (adverb)</li>
            </ol>
            <p>With these assumptions in place, we defined tokens as a triplet of feature+qualifier+modifier.</p> 
            <p>Some of our discoveries are mentioned below:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>“Service”has a high impact on rating. Combined with certain qualifier+modifier, it leads to very high or very low rating.</li>
                <li>“Fair price”usually leads to better ratings than“cheap price”.</li>
                <li>“Dirty Table” has a much more stronger negative impact on the review, than the positive impact of “Clean Table".</li>
            </ol>
            
            
            <h2>Data</h2>
            <p>
                The dataset used is the Yelp chalange data set 
            </p>
            <p>
                We extrcat the features(nouns) of the text, then we selected qualifiers (adjetive) for each features, 
                the qualifiers has a max distance of 5 words of the feature. The modifiers are the adverb that happens right before the qualifier
            </p>
            <p>
                We selected 3719 business of categories food and restaurant, and then 50 reviews with more votes (useful, cool or funny respectively) for each business, 
                these reviews have at least one feature with qualifier.
            </p>
            <p>
                We selected two different feature sets
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Frequency: The features with higher frequency in the dataset</li>
                <li>Discriminative: We selected the feature set by fiding which ones were more discriminative for restaurants, 
                to do that we compared features extracted for restaurants against fetures extracted for Automobile and Health business</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                To calculate the variance, we normalized the count for each star by first divinding the frequency 
                of each star in each feature by the total freqeuncy of the feature. Then we mutiplied the value of each star by a weight. 
                We got this weight by divinding the total of each star by the max of each star. 
            </p>
            <h2>Visualization</h2>
            <p>
               The scatter plot, presents each word as a dot, 
                the size is the Freqeuncy using a logarithmic scale, 
                The x axis is the average rating of the feature,
                The y axis is the variance.
            </p>
            <p>
                The higher the variance, the more strong the word is to a rating
            </p>
            <p>
               A hover dot becomes orange, a selected dot becmomes red.
            </p>
            <p>
                Each scatterplot has a list the of words ploted in it
            </p>
            <p>
                Two average rating are shown, the first is the normal average, the second is the average after applyed the weight 
                to reduce the impact of the star distribution of reviews on Yelp.
            </p>
            <p>
                The stripe at the top of the scatter plot, shows the frequency of the word, in reviews of each rating
            </p>
            <p>
                A feature can be added using the top bar, when this happens the new feature will be ploted in the chart and selected
            </p>
            <p>
                To remove a feature, qualifier or modifier the user shoul right click the dot. 
            </p>
            <p>
                When a word (feature, qualifier, modifier) is selected, 
                a list of reviews containing the combination of (feature, qualifier, modifier) is shown. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The user can click in one review to see the full text
            </p>
            <p>
                The user can group the reviews by business
            </p>
